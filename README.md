**Project Overview**
Futo Connect offers a platform where users can sign up either as clients or freelancers. Clients can post job listings, while freelancers can offer their services and skills. The goal is to build a community where students, alumni, and others can access freelance opportunities or find skilled workers to fulfill project needs.

**Features**
Client and Freelancer Signup: Users can sign up as either clients or freelancers.
Freelancer-Specific Fields: Freelancers provide additional details such as skills and portfolio links to help them stand out.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and clean UI for seamless registration.
Terms of Service & Privacy Policy: Links to legal documents during sign-up.

**Installation**
Once the project is set up, open the index.html file in your browser. Here’s what each part of the signup process entails:

**Signup Page:**
A simple form asks for the user's first name, last name, email, and password.
There’s a dropdown to select whether the user is a Client or Freelancer.
Freelancers will be prompted to provide additional information (skills and portfolio link).
After filling out the form, users can submit the information to sign up.
Users are presented with links to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
Dynamic Form Fields:

JavaScript ensures that when a freelancer selects their user type, additional fields (skills and portfolio) appear, while these fields are hidden for clients.
